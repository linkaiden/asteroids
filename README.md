# asteroids
In this repo we're creating the game "Asteroids" using Python and Pygame.

CONTROLS: W - Move forward | A - Rotate left | S - Move backwards | D - Rotate right | SPACE - Shoot!
Avoid colliding with the asteroids while shooting them to remove them from the field.

Logs:
Implemented Game loop and fps.
Implemented player rendering to display, player rotation, player movement and player speed.
Implemented asteroid rendering and collision between asteroids and the player.
Implemented shooting from the players position and rate limiting the amount of shots that can be done (0.3 rate limit)
Implemented asteroids and the player's shot disappearing when colliding.
Implemented asteroids that're large and medium splitting when hit by a projectile, causing 2 new asteroids (downsizing by 1) to spawn
and move in random directions.
End of Course. I might come back to this and implement rounds, power ups, etc.
